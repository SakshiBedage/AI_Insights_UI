# AI_Insights_UI

The AI Insights Dashboard is a React-based web application that provides a user-friendly interface to visualize AI-related insights using dynamic charts (Bar, Line, Pie, and Donut charts). The dashboard is powered by Redux for state management and Chart.js for rendering interactive charts. Users can toggle the visibility of different charts, each representing distinct data such as category distribution, response times, user satisfaction, and usage statistics.
